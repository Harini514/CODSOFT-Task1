OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

The Advanced Calculator project is a Python-based application designed to perform a variety of arithmetic and mathematical operations through a menu-driven interface. It is a robust tool suitable for beginners and intermediate users, combining fundamental programming concepts with modular design and error handling.

Key Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
Advanced Operations:

Exponentiation (Power function).
Modular Arithmetic (Remainder calculation).
Square Root (Error handling for negative inputs).
User-Friendly Interface:

Menu-driven interface with clear operation choices.
Continuous session until the user decides to quit.
Error Handling:

Prevents division by zero.
Handles invalid numeric inputs with user-friendly error messages.
Reusability:

Modular design with functions for each operation.
Easy to expand with new features.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
math (for square root and advanced calculations).

Conclusion
The Advanced Calculator project demonstrates the effective use of Python for creating a practical, menu-driven application that performs both basic and advanced mathematical operations. This project is an excellent example of how to combine core programming concepts like functions, loops, conditional statements, and error handling to build a user-friendly tool.
